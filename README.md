# FSND Capstone: Casting Agency
**API link:** (https://pcidale-fsnd-capstone.herokuapp.com/)

## Scope and Motivation

The scope of this project was suggested by the Udacity team to put into practice all modules that we studied so far:

* SQL and Data Modeling for the Web
* API Development and Documentation
* Identity and Access  Management
* Server Deployment, Containerization and Testing

In addition, it's been used Postman Collections for testing all APIâ€™s resources and Heroku for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in api.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

## Environment Variables

Before starting the API, it's required to define these variables:

* `DATABASE_URL`
* `AUTH0_DOMAIN`
* `AUTH0_ALGORITHMS`
* `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`

## Running the server

To run the server, execute:

```
export FLASK_APP=api.py
flask run --reload
```
